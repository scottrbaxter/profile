# Custom developer profile for various utilities

### deploy current profile in virtualbox / ubuntu 16.04

Packages required:
- virtualbox
- vagrant
- ansible

Easiest way to install these on MacOS is with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run:

`brew install virtualbox vagrant ansible`

Additionally, you will need to generate a private key:

`ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -q -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa-vagrant`

To test profile, run:

```
cd dev
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
```
